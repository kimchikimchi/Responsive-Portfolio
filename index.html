        <p>My name is Bikini the Cat.  Born in 2010 on a sunny day in Atlanta, GA, I am trice divorced mother to four lovely children named Furball, Coco, Tigger and Munchikin (pics are in my 'Portfolio' section.  Children are mother's greatest hits. Aren't they? ;-))  As you can tell from my profile picture, I've led a rather storied life with some very proud moments and others not so much.   In my wildest youth, I experimented with bootleg milk and catnips and partied with many feline models and rock-n-rollers in Nu Yok City.
        </p>

        <p>I am now happily retired from pet modeling and trying to lead a healthier life style away from spotlights and sins.  If I had a wish--which isn't so much in my humble opinion, I am currently seeking an available bachelor cat to spend my golden years with.  Please--<strong>no strays or rabid cats.</strong>  Have a blessed day.
